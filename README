Hello, thank you for downloading wired-php!

*
** Introduction 

  Wired-php is a web services client (xmlrpc protocol)
  to make reservations on line using WuBook Provider
  (http://wubook.net).

  You will need xmlrpc library installed:
   
   http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/

  Note: this is my first php work. If you encounter
  an improvable style, be conscious of that.

  If you want to contribute, simply contact me!

** Usage

  To discover how to use this library, please, refer
  directly to source code.

  wbxclient contains at the bottom a detailed HowTo.
  More documention is coming asap.
